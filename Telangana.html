     Telangana
    </h1>
    <h3>Telangana[a] is a state in India situated in the south-central part of the Indian subcontinent on the high Deccan Plateau.[14] It borders Maharashtra to the north, Chhattisgarh to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the southeast, and Karnataka to the southwest. It is the eleventh largest state by area and the twelfth most populated state in India, according to the 2011 census.[15] On 2 June 2014, Telangana was separated from the northwestern part of United Andhra Pradesh as a newly formed state, with Hyderabad as its capital.

Telugu, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and the primary official language of Telangana state, whereas Urdu is recognised as the second official language. Additionally, several tribal languages such as Gondi, Kolami, Koya and Lambadi are spoken in different regions of the state.

    A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.

    Warangal takes you back to the era of kings and queens with its beautiful historical sites and an impressive natural beauty with Parkhal Lake being worth checking out.

The Warangal city is credited as the fifth largest city in this state. The legends have it that it was known as Oruguallu or Omtikonda or Ekasilanagaram mainly due to the existence of a huge hillock which seemed to have been carved out entirely off one stone. Warangal takes you back to the era of kings and queens with its beautiful historical sites. Warangal natural beauty is no less impressive and the Parkhal Lake and wildlife sanctuaries are also definitely worth checking out. Warangal also houses a National Institute of Technology(NIT) which has made it a famous student hub today.
